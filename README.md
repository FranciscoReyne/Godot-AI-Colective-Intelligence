# Godot-AI-Colective-Intelligence

Teams of AI Agents for Collective Intelligence Analysis using Godot frameworks.

## Information about previous (human kind) collective intelligence Tests:

| Dimension | Characteristic Tasks |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Idea Generation** | • Creative brainstorming<br>• Word association<br>• Verbal riddle solving |
| **Decision Making** | • Quantity estimation<br>• Event prediction<br>• Selection among alternatives<br>• Coordination games |
| **Collective Memory** | • Recalling shared information<br>• Group reconstruction of events<br>• Transactive memory tasks |
| **Social Processing** | • Emotion interpretation<br>• Lie detection<br>• Evaluation of social intentions |
| **Problem Solving** | • Collective construction puzzles<br>• Collaborative escape rooms<br>• Interdependent logic challenges |
| **Motor Coordination** | • Synchronized movement<br>• Group object manipulation tasks |
| **Perspective Integration** | • Building collective maps<br>• Reconciliation of partial information |
| **Collective Learning** | • Adaptation to changing rules<br>• Knowledge transfer between members |

These tasks are typically combined into test batteries that evaluate a group's general collective intelligence capacity.

## Adaptation from human to LLM collective intelligence test. 

**Here's an adaptation of collective intelligence tests tailored for an LLM like Claude, ChatGPT and Deepseek.**

| Dimension | Tasks adapted for LLMs |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Idea Generation** | • Produce multiple solutions to hypothetical problems<br>• Generate creative variations on a theme<br>• Propose novel analogies and metaphors |
| **Decision Making** | • Evaluate probabilities of events based on partial information<br>• Rank options according to multiple criteria<br>• Make inferences with constraints |
| **Collective Memory** | • Synthesize information from previous conversations<br>• Maintain consistency in reasoning over time<br>• Integrate knowledge from different domains |
| **Social Processing** | • Interpret emotional nuances in texts<br>• Identify biases and fallacies in arguments<br>• Distinguish between opinions and facts |
| **Problem Solving** | • Break down complex problems into subproblems<br>• Optimize solutions with multiple constraints<br>• Generate algorithms to solve logical puzzles |
| **Textual Coordination** | • Maintain consistent styles across different sections<br>• Align formats and structures in extensive documents |
| **Perspective Integration** | • Synthesize opposing positions<br>• Generate impartial summaries of debates<br>• Combine diverse perspectives into a coherent narrative |
| **Adaptive Learning** | • Refine responses based on feedback<br>• Adapt explanation level according to context<br>• Transfer solutions between similar domains |

*These tasks can be implemented through specific prompts that evaluate each dimension of the LLM's ability to process, integrate, and generate information collaboratively with humans or other systems.*
